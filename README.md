# Coleco Zodiac table calculator
Python 3 script to create birthday tables for the [Coleco Zodiac](http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Coleco/Zodiac.htm)

Needs [PySwissEph](https://github.com/astrorigin/pyswisseph) to run.

coleco_zodiac_table.txt contains the output of the program from 1900 to 2100.

Note that the codes computed by this script may differ slightly from those in the Coleco Zodiac manual (on pages 17 to 30).

Also note the daily preview/advice codes seem to work differently and that this table is not for them!
